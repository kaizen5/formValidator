### Vanilla JS Form Validator

Simple setup validator for all your form needs.  Work in progress.

## TO USE:

> Must have a container that defines the form area (does not have to be a <form> element)
> Add data-validate='[RULESET]' to any element.
> Only add data-required=false if it is optional.  We assume it is required.
> Initialize validator in your JS using ```new``` operator.

**This is a work in progress.**
